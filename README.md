# Logstash REST Filter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gandalfb/logstash-filter-rest.svg?branch=feature%2Ftesting-extended)](https://travis-ci.org/gandalfb/logstash-filter-rest)

This is a filter plugin for [Logstash](https://github.com/elasticsearch/logstash).

It is fully free and fully open source. The license is Apache 2.0, meaning you are pretty much free to use it however you want in whatever way.

## Documentation

This logstash filter provides an easy way to access RESTful Resources within logstash. It can be used to post data to a REST API or to gather data and save it in your log file.

## Usage
### 1. Installation
You can use the built-in plugin tool of Logstash to install the filter:
```
$LS_HOME/bin/plugin install logstash-filter-rest
```

Or you can build it yourself:
```
git clone https://github.com/lucashenning/logstash-filter-rest.git
bundle install
gem build logstash-filter-rest.gemspec
$LS_HOME/bin/plugin install logstash-filter-rest-0.1.0.gem
```

### 2. Filter Configuration
Add the following inside the filter section of your logstash configuration:

```sh
filter {
  rest {
    request => {
      url => "http://example.com"       # string (required, with field reference: "http://example.com?id=%{id}" or params, if defined)
      method => "post"                  # string (optional, default = "get")
      headers => {                       # hash (optional)
        "key1" => "value1"
        "key2" => "value2"
      }
      auth => {
        user => "AzureDiamond"
        password => "hunter2"
      }
      params => {                       # hash (optional, available for method => "get" and "post"; if post it will be transformed into body hash and posted as json)
        "key1" => "value1"
        "key2" => "value2"
        "key3" => "%{somefield}"        # Please set sprintf to true if you want to use field references
      }
    }
    json => true                      # boolean (optional, default = false)
    sprintf => true                   # boolean (optional, default = false, set this to true if you want to use field references in url, header or params)
    target => "my_key"          # string (optional, default = "rest_response")
    fallback => {                     # hash describing a default in case of error
      "key1" => "value1"
      "key2" => "value2"
    }
  }
}
```

All contributions are welcome: ideas, patches, documentation, bug reports, complaints, and even something you drew up on a napkin.

Programming is not a required skill. Whatever you've seen about open source and maintainers or community members  saying "send patches or die" - you will not see that here.

It is more important to the community that you are able to contribute.
